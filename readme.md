# Zen Menu Reveal Animation for Firefox

This mod provides a clean, elegant, and professional staggered menu item reveal animation for the Firefox main menu (up to 48 items, fast and smooth). It is a pure CSS solutionâ€”no settings, no scripts, just drop-in style enhancement for a modern look and feel.

## Features

- Smooth, staggered reveal animation for menu items
- Lightweight and fast (CSS only)
- No dependencies or configuration required

## Installation

1. Download or copy the `chrome.css` file from this repository.
2. Place it in your Firefox profile's `chrome` folder (create the folder if it doesn't exist).
3. Make sure userChrome.css is enabled in Firefox (see Mozilla documentation for details).
4. Restart Firefox to see the new menu animation in action.
